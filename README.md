# Health Hackathon (For Detecting Early onset of depression)

Welcome to our innovative platform dedicated to early detection of depression, crafted with care and expertise by our team for the Weal Health Hackathon. In today's fast-paced world, mental health awareness is more crucial than ever, and our mission is to provide a solution that empowers individuals to take proactive steps towards their well-being.

Our website utilizes a blend of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask to deliver a seamless and user-friendly experience. With a focus on accessibility and ease of use, our platform aims to reach a wide audience and offer valuable insights into one's mental health.

We have also integrated a chatbot in this project which uses large language models and fine tuning to create a chatbot which can speak with a user, determine whether or not they are depressed, and suggest verbal countermeasures after interacting with the user by asking a set of questions genearted by the bot .
